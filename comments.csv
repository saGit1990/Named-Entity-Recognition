1,"Sweden will go from being a net importer of
renewable diesel to a net exporter in 2024, as recent
changes in mandates for greenhouse gas reduction in
road fuels cut demand in the Nordic country.
Sweden is to lower the greenhouse gas reduction
target for road fuels to 6% in 2024 from a 2010 baseline
and for it to remain at that level until the end of 2026.
The country’s outgoing GHG reduction mandate
is 30.5% for diesel and 7.8% for gasoline, levels that
had been previously set rise to rise to 40% and 12.5%,
respectively, in 2024.
Nordic refiners Preem and Neste have pushed
ahead with biofuel expansion plans, as producers
have scrambled for market share in Europe’s clean
energy sector.
Finnish refiner Neste has begun transforming its
206,000 b/d Porvoo refinery into a “renewable and
circular solutions refining hub,” the company said in a
statement Dec. 20.
In plans to develop “the most sustainable refinery in
Europe,” Neste aims to scale up renewable and circular
products capacity at Porvoo to 3 million mt, focusing
on renewable diesel, sustainable aviation fuel and
renewable feedstocks for the polymers and chemicals
industry.
Preem, Sweden’s largest refiner, has also progressed
with ambitions in the biofuel space, announcing its
first biodiesel export from its 125,000 b/d Gothenburg
refinery Dec. 20.
Between its Gothenburg and Lyeskil refineries,
Preem aims to reach production capacity of
2.5 million cu m of renewable fuel by 2027,
and plans to double capacity by 2035.
In its latest move to scale supplies, the company
announced plans to repurpose part of its Lysekil
refinery for SAF and HVO production in an
SEK5.5 billion ($525.9 million) investment, which
it says will drive forward ambitions to become the
largest SAF producer in Northern Europe.",APAG 20240102 Pg 5,"Sweden will become a net exporter of renewable diesel in 2024 due to changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction mandates, lowering the target to 6% from a 2010 baseline until 2026.

2,"Asia jet fuel/kerosene market participants eye
higher Jan export volumes from China
„ India’s Nov jet fuel/kerosene exports climb to threemonth
high of 743,000 mt
Asian jet fuel/kerosene maintained a steady footing
midweek even as some participants eyed higher
regional supplies on expectations of higher outflows of
aviation fuel from China.
While some sectors of the market said they
anticipate middle distillate demand to remain largely
stable over January, other sources said that supply
factors stemming from Chinese jet fuel/kerosene
exports, as well as Red Sea concerns, could contribute
to growing length in the region.
Estimates gathered from industry participants Jan.
3 threw up varying export figures for January, with
volumes ranging from 1.22 million mt to up to 2 million
mt. China’s December exports of jet fuel/kerosene have
been estimated at around 1.2 million mt.
China issued 19 million mt, or 151.05 million barrels,
of export quotas for clean oil products in its first batch
for 2024, S&P Global Commodity Insights previously
reported, with analysts saying in a report Jan. 2 that
the country’s Q1 exports are expected to rebound to
almost 900,000 b/d, supported by this first batch.
“The new round of export quotas is poised to boost
gasoline, diesel and jet fuel exports from December
lows. Muted trading activity and robust travel demand
during the holiday season in February 2024 will also
keep exports at a relatively low level in the first quarter
of 2024 [as compared to Q1 2023],” the report said,
adding that “looking into the first quarter of 2024, with
travel interest during the Spring Festival holiday, which
falls entirely in February, we expect gasoline and jet

The volume in December was, however, 84.2%
higher compared with the same period a year earlier
when traded volumes totaled 3.8 million barrels.
Industry sources attributed the month-on-month
decrease in the traded volume to uneven regional
demand as market participants wound down for the
year-end holidays.

4,"Asia’s low sulfur fuel oil market structure was
seen holding near prevailing levels Jan. 3, after
cash differential for the marine fuel grade slipped
on weaker buying interests for H2 January-loading
cargoes.
Traders, however, said any further downside would
likely be limited and the market would stay mostly rangebound due to unviable arbitrage economics
and persistent lack of supplies from Kuwait’s Al-Zour

at a premium of $3.66/mt in December, compared
with the November average at a discount of $2.55/mt,
according to the data.

adequate, trade sources said.
But term contractual supply of Singapore ex-wharf
380 CST high sulfur fuel oil cargoes for January were
concluded at premiums of around $4-$6/mt over
the benchmark FOB Singapore 380 CST HSFO cargo

clarity as spot activity picks up.
Expectations of more supply stemming from China
in January could weigh on balances, some sources
said, with others pointing out that given the wide
estimates of export volumes for the month, the outlook
for fundamentals was still hazy.
Industry sources earlier this week had estimated
China’s January export volumes of jet fuel at anywhere
from 1.22 million-2 million mt, S&P Global Commodity

China’s December exports of jet fuel/kerosene have
been estimated at around 1.2 million mt, down from
November’s outflow of 1.59 million mt.
In Vietnam, State-run PetroVietnam’s Binh Son
Refining and Petrochemical, or BSR, has raised the
production capacity of jet fuel at its 130,000 b/d
refinery at Dung Quat to 140% from 135%, an official at
BSR said Jan. 3.
The hike in capacity at Dung Quat’s kerosene
treatment unit since late December is to meet rising
demand of jet fuel ahead of Vietnam’s Lunar New
Year festival, which will take place during Feb. 8-14,
and to take advantage of high prices of jet fuel, the
official said.

Open interest in the front-month January Singapore
jet fuel/kerosene contract fell 25.93% on the month to
9.797 million barrels.
Still, trade participants remain cautiously optimistic
about recovery prospects for jet fuel/kerosene due to
continued strength in the aviation sector among global
and regional air travel demand, S&P Global analysts
said in their Asia Refined Products Short-Term Outlook
for January.
“Mainland China and Southeast Asia will continue
to lead the regional jet fuel/kerosene growth at a rate
of 220,000 b/d and 126,000 b/d, respectively,” the

Looking ahead, the increase from 2024 to 2025 is
expected to be 81%.
Europe will account for over half of sustainable
aviation fuel production in 2024, but sustained growth
will depend on the way policies are designed.

Taiwan’s demand for diesel was 4.2% higher
on the month and 7.7% on the year at 109,000 b/d
in November, latest data from Taiwan’s Energy
Administration showed.
Industry sources said that Taiwan mainly uses diesel
for power generation. As such, diesel consumption
may remain volatile due to a combination of a shift
toward renewable energy and broader economic
considerations impacting consumption levels.
“Summer is the peak season for power generation
[in Taiwan],” a Northeast Asian-based source said.
In the UAE, stockpiles of oil products at the Port
of Fujairah climbed 10% in the week ended Jan. 1,
according to data from the Fujairah Oil Industry Zone
published Jan. 3. The total rose to 19.204 million barrels
as of Jan. 1, the highest in 12 weeks, although middle
distillates stocks dropped 21% to 1.987 million barrels,
an eight-week low",APAG 20240104 Pg 11,"The Asian gasoil market remained steady on Jan. 4, with the cash differential for FOB 10 ppm sulfur gasoil retreating slightly after reaching a near two-month high. The differential for Straits-loading ultra-low sulfur gasoil cargoes edged 8 cents/b lower to 94 cents/b. Gasoil demand is expected to remain stable, but disruptions in the Red Sea could impact supply. China's clean fuel exports are projected to rise in Q1 and Q2 2024. Vietnam's Petrolimex and South Korea's GS Caltex are active in the spot market. Taiwan's diesel demand increased in November.

9,"Asia’s low sulfur fuel oil market structure and
refining margins were seen weaker Jan. 4 as traders
said the prompt market has adequate supplies, but
any major downside would likely be capped due to the
currently shut West-East arbitrage window.
The Singapore marine fuel 0.5%S balance January-
February swaps time spread was pegged at $6.75/
mt in midafternoon trading Jan. 4, down from the
Platts assessment of the spread at $7/mt at the Asian
close Jan. 3.
The Singapore front-month LSFO refining margin
against Brent crude, which was assessed 67 cents
higher on the day Jan. 3 at $12.70/b, was pegged lower
at around $12.10/b in midafternoon Asian trade Jan. 4.
Platts assessed Singapore marine fuel 0.5%S cash
premium over the Mean of Platts Singapore marine
fuel 0.5%S assessment at $5.02/mt Jan. 3, compared
with $5.35/mt Jan. 2. The cash premium has shed 18%
so far this week, and was at its lowest level since mid-
September when it was assessed at $3.38/mt, S&P
Global Commodity Insights data showed.
“The LSFO market is still looking a bit heavy on the
front,” a Singapore-based trader said, adding that he
was expecting the cash premiums to stay relatively
rangebound in the coming days.
Meanwhile, Platts assessed the Singapore 380 CST
high sulfur fuel oil cash differential over the MOPS 380
CST HSFO assessment at a higher premium of $10/mt
Jan. 3, lifted by active buying interests from Sinopec
during the Platts Market on Close assessment process.
The benchmark HSFO cash premium, which was
assessed at $8.25/mt Jan. 2, was at its highest level
since Sept. 13 when it was assessed at $11.21/mt, S&P
Global data showed.
The spread between Singapore 0.5% sulfur marine
fuel oil and the benchmark HSFO cargo prices — known
as the Hi-5 spread — was assessed at $127.62/mt
Jan. 3, down from $142.72/mt Jan. 2, S&P Global data
showed. The spread has narrowed nearly 13% in the
last two weeks, S&P Global data showed.
The Singapore 380 CST HSFO balance January-
February market structure was pegged at $12.75/mt
in midafternoon Asian trade Jan. 4, against the Platts

Intercontinental Exchange data showed Jan. 4.
In the UAE, stockpiles of oil products at the Port of
Fujairah climbed 10% in the week ended Jan. 1, led by
a record 55% jump in light distillates such as gasoline
and naphtha, according to data from the Fujairah Oil
Industry Zone.
Stocks of heavy distillates and residues used for
power generation and shipping, however, declined 1.9%
to 9.953 million barrels, the lowest in three weeks, the
data showed. Demand for LSFO and aggressive selling
in HSFO for shipping helped to push heavy distillate
and residue stockpiles lower, traders said Jan. 3.
In other statistics, Taiwan’s fuel oil demand in
November dropped 9.3% on the year but was up 14.9%

10,"Activity was picking up in the Asian sour crude market
Jan. 4, as the UAE’s ADNOC released its latest February
official selling prices, while Intercontinental Exchange
data showed open interest in front-month Dubai
futures contracts easing on the month.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Co. has set the February

Forecasts about the March-loading trading cycle
was mixed among participants, with some still seeing
weak demand in the region, particularly from China,
while others noted that refiners still had to procure
cargoes even with the spring turnaround season.
February-loading barrels from the previous cycle
were heard to be mostly cleared, though a sizeable
overhang of at least 15 million barrels in the West
African market — just for January-loading — would
likely weigh on lighter, sweeter barrels from the Middle
East such as Murban crude, according to sources.
“Russian barrels to China, India are also offsetting
demand for Middle East grades,” a source at a North
Asian refiner said.
“Market is still quite undecided. It’s macro versus
fundamentals,” a Singapore-based trader said.
